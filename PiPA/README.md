# Pi Personal Assistance (Aka PiPA Pronounced Pie Pah)
Virtual assistants are everywhere now, making life easier than ever for us. Our project would serve as an assistant in a world that asks us to do so many things in so little time. By simply being able to say what you need, rather than taking the time to pull out your phone or planner and write it down, you’re offered a new level of freedom and increased daily efficiency. By providing users the ability to build to-do lists, write notes, and more, we have the ability to explore a new technology that we can actually put to good use.

While there is a ton of documentation for building virtual assistants using Python and other languages, we have a unique opportunity to explore this space using C#. It will be a very engaging process to work to translate our needs from one language to another, and even adapt our own implementations. This will provide the unique opportunity to contribute to a community that has given so much to us. Additionally, it is really great knowing we are the first team to tackle this in the 6 ASP.NET Core cohorts to pass through Code Fellows.
