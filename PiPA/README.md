# Project: Pi Personal Assistance (Aka PiPA Pronounced Pie Pah)
##### (We are deployed on Azure at https://pipaweb.azurewebsites.net/)

## What is PiPA?
Virtual assistants are everywhere now, making life easier than ever for us. Our project serves as an assistant in a world that asks us to do so many things in so little time. By simply being able to say what you need, rather than taking the time to pull out your phone or planner and write it down, youâ€™re offered a new level of freedom and increased daily efficiency, by providing users the ability to build to-do lists.

We accomplished this by utilizing the Azure Cognitive Services library for speech to text in combination with a full CRUD MVC application. 
A user will register (or log in) to our site and is able to see, create, update, or delete tasks. In addition to this MVC ability,  we created a console application which runs on a secondary device. The Cognitive Services library allows us to persist new tasks to our Tasks table within our Azure database.
In addition to verbally adding tasks, users have the ability to create, view, edit, or delete tasks from the user interface. 

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 (Version 15.9.4)
- C#
- ASP.Net Core
- Entity Framework
- MVC
- xUnit
- Azure
- Bulma
- Azure Cognitive Services

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
$ git clone -------Fill this in after we move from ADO---------------
```
Utilize dotnet CLI or Visual Studio, to build the solution. The dotnet tools will automatically restore any NuGet dependencies. 

Before running the application, one will need to add the migraton and update their database for both DBContexts (ApplicationDbcontext and PADbcontext) SQL server of your choice.

## Usage
--------------THIS IS WHERE THE IMAGES OF THE SITE WILL GO----------
